<h2>what it is</h2>
<p>This is a place to show off your hand made action figures and sculptures. Found objects are never
 lost here. &nbsp;&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>While here you can chat with others who share the same passion to create, check out their
 galleries of creations, and have fun. You can write blog entries and upload photos or movies of
 your creations in action.</p>

<h2>how it began...</h2>
<p><em class="siteName">creationpodz</em> was born of the glorious ideas of a "little kid". (Don't
 call <?=anchor('/user/Sam', 'him')?> that, though; you'll upset him.) When I was a young boy I
 played with action figures, as did all my friends. I couldn't help but buy some action figures for
 my son, even when he was barely more than an infant.</p>
<p>Of course, his playing progressed as his imagination did. In many ways it outgrew the pre-defined
 roles and stories available with factory-produced action figures. Sure, re-creating the stories
 written in Hollywood was fun, but this boy had bigger and better ideas.</p>
<p>So he'd grab some materials and set off on new journeys. He'd create the figures himself. This
 site is one he asked for as a place to share and show off his creations. I only took his idea and
 ran with it, allowing others to jump on the train with us before it left the station.</p>
